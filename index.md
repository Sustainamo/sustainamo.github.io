# Introduction
## Purpose
This guide is intended to provide guidance on how to create, implement, monitor and then review and iterate a sustainability strategy.  It has been created to support people who are new to doing so, or those with experience who are reviewing their current approach, and aims to fill the gap provided by other guidance which tends to focus more on some “quick steps” to be more sustainable (such as ‘minimise waste’ and ‘try to recycle’), rather than how to approach creating and implementing a comprehensive strategy.

## Content
The guide will provide a high-level overview of the elements of a sustainability strategy, and the steps to creating and then implementing one.  “Sustainability strategy” is used to refer to how you will approach and implement sustainability within your organisation and/or event.  This guide will provide an overview of what this entails, and targeted support on approaching aspects within a strategy (such as how to create an overarching sustainability vision, develop goals, policies and KPIs, etc), as well as more specific guidance for when creating policies for some common areas such as waste or transport.  

## Limitations
To be effective, a sustainability strategy must be tailored to the specifics of the organisation or event it is being applied to, and so it is not possible to create a one-size fits all approach.  This guidance will provide support to develop your strategy’s structure, and to build out its component elements, though in keeping with International Standards such as ISO14001 or ISO20121, recognises that ultimately the details must be furnished by the organisations themselves. 

## The meaning of sustainability
Although sustainability is a commonly used word, it lacks without a universally agreed definition, with its exact meaning often specific to the context in which it is used.  The Brundtland report definition (1987) is the most widely cited: Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, which was expanded upon at the later Rio summit declaration (1992), saying Sustainability is comprised of “three pillars”: Environmental, Social, and Economic.  

Your organisation may already have policies in place to ensure wellbeing in one or all of these areas, so the scope of your sustainability strategy, and/or it’s interrelation / reference to other areas of your organisation will be unique to your given organisation.  

# Guide structure
 The guide is composed of three main elements:

•	Being sustainable
A high-level overview of what is involved in creating a sustainability strategy and then implementing it.  This will provide a broad-picture of what is involved and some key considerations whilst  steps to getting there.   
•	Implementation guidance
More detailed support on how to approach various aspects of the strategy, such as creating a overarching vision, undertaking stakeholder engagement, or… <MAY END UP A STEP BY STEP GUIDE?>
